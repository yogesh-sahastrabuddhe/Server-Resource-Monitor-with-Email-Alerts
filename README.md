- **üè∑Ô∏è Keywords:** automation, python, Server monitoring, Resource monitoring, CPU usage, Memory usage, psutil, Email alerts, SMTP

## Features


- Monitors CPU and Memory usage using `psutil`
- Configurable thresholds for CPU and Memory utilization
- Sends email alerts via SMTP (supports Gmail)
- Logs monitoring activity and email alerts to a log file
- Runs continuously, checking resources every 5 minutes (configurable)


## Installation


1. Clone this repository or download the script file.

2. Install the required Python package:    pip install psutil

3.  Update the email and monitoring configuration in the script or via environment variables: EMAIL_FROM = "your_email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_TO = "recipient_email@example.com"
EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"





## Usage

Run the script with:  python server_monitor.py



## Prerequisites


- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Access to an SMTP email server (e.g., Gmail)
- `psutil` Python package installed

## Code overview


- `send_email(subject, body)`: Sends an email alert with the provided subject and body.
- `check_system_resources()`: Checks current CPU and memory usage and triggers email alerts if thresholds are exceeded.
- The main loop runs `check_system_resources()` every configured interval (`CHECK_INTERVAL`).


## Troubleshooting


- Ensure your Python environment has `psutil` installed.
- Verify SMTP server settings and credentials are correct.
- Check that your network allows outbound connections to the SMTP server.
- If email sending fails, review error messages in the log file `server_monitor.log`.
- Make sure to use app-specific passwords if using Gmail or similar services.
- For issues with logging or script not running continuously, confirm the script is executed in a persistent terminal or use a process manager.
